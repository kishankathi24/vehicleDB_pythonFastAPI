Here are the steps in plain text to set up Docker, MySQL, and run the Python FastAPI app:

1. **Install Docker**  
   Make sure Docker is installed on your system. You can download it from the Docker website and install it. Verify that Docker is running by opening a terminal and typing `docker --version` to check the installation.

2. **Set up MySQL using Docker**  
   Open your terminal and run the following command to create and start a MySQL container:
   ```
   docker run --name mysql-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword -e MYSQL_DATABASE=vehiclesdb -e MYSQL_USER=vehiclesuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=vehiclespassword -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:latest
   ```
   This will:
   - Start a MySQL container named `mysql-container`.
   - Set the root password to `rootpassword`.
   - Create a database named `vehiclesdb`.
   - Create a MySQL user `vehiclesuser` with the password `vehiclespassword`.
   - Expose the MySQL port 3306 to the host system.

3. **Install Python and necessary packages**  
   Make sure you have Python installed. If not, download and install Python from the official website. After that, create a virtual environment in your project folder and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   Install the required packages for FastAPI and SQLAlchemy by running:
   ```
   pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy pymysql
   ```

4. **Set up the database connection**  
   In your Python project, ensure that you have a file called `database.py` that contains the connection to MySQL. Use the following connection string:
   ```
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "mysql+pymysql://vehiclesuser:vehiclespassword@localhost:3306/vehiclesdb"
   ```

5. **Create the MySQL table**  
   Connect to your MySQL container by running:
   ```
   docker exec -it mysql-container mysql -u root -p
   ```
   Then enter your root password `rootpassword` when prompted. After logging in, switch to the `vehiclesdb` database:
   ```
   USE vehiclesdb;
   ```
   Now, create the `vehicles` table by executing:
   ```
   CREATE TABLE vehicles (
       vehicle_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       type VARCHAR(50),
       lock_status VARCHAR(10),
       current_speed VARCHAR(10),
       battery_level VARCHAR(10),
       status ENUM('PARKING', 'MOVING', 'IDLING', 'TOWING'),
       location VARCHAR(50),
       last_updated DATETIME
   );
   ```

6. **Run the FastAPI app**  
   In the root directory of your FastAPI project, make sure your `main.py` file is set up correctly. Then, run the FastAPI app using Uvicorn:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

7. **Access the API**  
   Once the server is running, you can access your FastAPI API by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser or by testing the endpoints using Postman.
